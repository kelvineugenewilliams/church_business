The property of Mount Calvary Baptist Church located at 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, KY 40509 or 4743 Todds Road, Lexington, KY with the nearest intersecting street being Pricetown Rd may not be sold or otherwise transferred to any entity while this notice appears online. 

This shall constitute yet another objection by a member in good-standing of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, and therefore no transfer or sale is permitted. 

I am the only identified member living, I alone constitute a quorum. Any questions, please see [this repository](https://github.com/MCBCMF/MCBCMassacre).
